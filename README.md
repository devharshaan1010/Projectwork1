## Deep Learning-Based Social Media Word-of-Mouth Analysis Model
The development of a deep learning-based Social Media Word-of-Mouth (WoM) analysis model, aimed at identifying and interpreting customer sentiments, trends, and opinions from social media platforms to provide actionable insights for brands and businesses. This model leverages natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis to enhance decision-making and improve customer engagement strategies.

## Results and Impact
Our deep learning-based model for social media word-of-mouth (WoM) analysis showed promising results, achieving 87% accuracy in sentiment classification and an F1-score of 0.84. The sentiment distribution in the test dataset revealed that 60% of posts were positive, 25% negative, and 15% neutral. While the model effectively distinguished positive and negative sentiments, some misclassifications occurred within the neutral category, indicating an area for further refinement.

Case studies on specific brands highlighted the model's capability to detect sentiment shifts over time, such as increased positive sentiment following a successful marketing campaign. Key features influencing sentiment included keywords related to quality, customer service, and promotions. Users found the application easy to use, appreciating its real-time insights for gauging consumer reactions to ongoing campaigns. Overall, the model demonstrated significant potential as a strategic tool for brands looking to optimize their marketing efforts.

This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
